A minimalist Android widget that lets you lock your screen with a double tap. Perfect for one-handed use and quick screen locking.

## Why TapLock?

While there are several screen-locking apps available on the Play Store, they all share a concerning characteristic: they're closed source while requiring significant system permissions. 

The Accessibility Service permission, which is necessary for screen locking functionality, is particularly powerful - it can:

- Monitor all your interactions with apps
- View your screen content
- Track your inputs and gestures
- Access sensitive information

With closed-source applications, you're essentially trusting unknown code with these extensive capabilities. You have no way to verify:
- What data they're actually collecting
- Where that data might be sent
- What other hidden functionalities might exist
- How securely they handle their permissions

TapLock solves this trust problem through radical transparency:
- 100% open source - every line of code is visible and auditable
- No internet permissions - physically cannot transmit data
- Minimal, focused codebase - easy to review and verify
- Uses Accessibility Service solely for screen locking - nothing else
- No analytics, no tracking, no data collection
- No unnecessary permissions or features

You don't have to trust our privacy claims - you can verify them yourself in the source code. This is the key advantage of open-source security: trust through transparency.
